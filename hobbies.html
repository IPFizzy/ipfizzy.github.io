            <h2 class="header">Video Games</h2>
            <p>Video Games have been a central part of my life for as long as I can remember. It all started when my
                parents lended me my first Gameboy Advance when I was 3 years old and I have loved video games ever
                since. To date, I have played and finished hundreds of games, and I have thousands more sitting in my
                library waiting to be played. What started as my biggest hobby even turned into a profession in the form
                of esports. I started competing in Fortnite tournaments at age 15 and actually did pretty good. I still
                keep up with Fortnite esports today and compete in some other games too. Take a look at some of my
                gaming achievements in the table below!</p>

            <h2 class="header">Drums</h2>
            <p>Simularly to Video Games, drumming has also always been a passion of mine. We even have family videos of
                me banging on toy drums as a baby. I have been playing a drums off an on for over 10 years now, but
                have really gotten serious about it in the last year or two. Aside from drums I have a passion for all
                things music and especially love the band Twenty One Pilots (give them a listen!) so being able to play
                to their music with my own instrument only adds to my love of music. Below is a video clip of me playing
                the drums to Twenty One Pilots' song Lane Boy!</p>

            <h2 class="header">Pickleball</h2>
            <p>Pickleball is my newest hobby. If you haven't noticed already, I'm a bit of a nerdy type, and aside from
                drumming, I didn't have much of an athletic hobby. I have bounced around tons of different sports
                growing
                up and my favorite by far was Tennis. So when I learned there was an even more beginner friendly sport
                like Tennis
                than I can play with family and all my friends were getting into, I also had to hop on the bandwagon. I
                even competed in my first tournament with a friend of mine this year (that's where the picture on the
                right came from)! Pickleball to date has become my all time favorite sport and something I plan on
                keeping up with in my busy lifestyle.</p>

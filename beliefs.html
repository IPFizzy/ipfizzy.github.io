            <h2 class="header">What I Believe</h2> <!-- Section header -->
            <p>
                I’m a non-denominational Christian who believes salvation is found in Jesus alone. He is the way, the
                truth, and the life. I do my best to follow scripture and grow in both knowledge and my personal walk.
                <br><br>
                I believe that the Bible is the ultimate authority, and I try to live by it in both my private life and
                in public. I’m constantly learning, whether through sermons, studies, or just late-night questions I
                bring to prayer. My faith helps keep me grounded no matter what I’m facing in school, work, or
                relationships.
                <br><br>
                I don’t see my faith as a Sunday-only kind of thing. It shows up in how I handle conflict, how I treat
                others, and how I carry myself in tough seasons. I try to walk in humility and boldness, trusting that
                God’s Word is true and worth sharing.
                <br><br>
                These verses describe my core beliefs:

            <h2 class="header">Living Out My Faith</h2> <!-- Section header -->
            <p>
                My faith isn't just something I believe in, it’s something I try to live out daily. Whether it’s leading
                students at church, showing patience in hard moments, or just staying grounded in truth when life gets
                chaotic, I want my actions to reflect who I follow.
                <br><br>
                Even when I fall short (and I often do), I try to return to grace, accountability, and growth. Being a
                Christian doesn’t mean being perfect, it means recognizing where I need help and turning to Christ in
                that process.
            </p>

                    <h3><strong>Church Involvement</strong></h3> <!-- Left column header -->
                    <p>
                        I serve weekly as a small group leader for middle school boys. It's one of the most rewarding
                        and humbling things I do. I’ve learned how important it is to show up for people, build trust,
                        and help others grow, even when you're still growing too. These students challenge me to be
                        better in my own walk every week.

                    <h3><strong>Daily Walk</strong></h3> <!-- Right column header -->
                    <p>
                        I study apologetics, journal my prayers, and spend time in the Word. I try to keep a rhythm of
                        quiet time to reflect, reset, and stay rooted in truth. That daily connection is what helps me
                        face pressure at school or work without losing sight of what matters most.

                <h3>Discord</h3>
                <p>My biggest projects stem from pre-existing platforms with Discord leading the charge. I host my own
                    "server" on discord where all of my friends and hundreds of other people can hang out in text or
                    voice chats. Using this platform I have been able to develop engaging bots that you can use to play
                    games, listen to music, and interact this others, using JavaScript and Discord as the UI.</p>

                <h3>Launch Box</h3>
                <p>Launch Box is a tool that allows you to host all of your PC video games into one central front-end
                    software. I have used this app to develop my own branch of the software to manage my video game
                    collection how I find most useful. The majority of this project does not involve any code, instead
                    it's more of a creative project. I currently have almost 20,000 games across over 30 different
                    platforms organized into my Launch Box.</p>

                <h3>Notion</h3>
                <p>Notion is the heart and soul of my projects. Notion is an online platform advertised as a "note
                    taking app." However, it's essentially a website builder focused around productivity. I have been
                    developing my own website for a few years as it has become like a second brain for me. Some features
                    include a habit tracker, finance tracker, project matrix, note taking library, and so much more.</p>

                <h3>Personal Projects</h3>
                <p>As I said before, most of my larger projects have been made off the backs of other pre-made pieces of
                    software. Looking forward I hope to adapt my projects around my own foundation without relying on
                    something pre-made. I plan to continue the other projects listed here, but possibility replace the
                    3ed party software with my own.</p>

                I currently work in Information Technology Operations as a Help Desk Technician at Fire Mountain Gems
                and Beads. I started this position around mid April as a sudo promotion from my internship at the same
                company (more on that in the "Past" section below). My day to day job is receiving user tickets that
                include tech issues, projects, requests, and much more. I take these tickets and direct them to whoever
                specializes in the issue on the I.T. team. All of the miscellaneous tickets however, I take care of.
                This includes working with the user's software and hardware, assisting with account issues, building
                workstations, patching systems, and so on.

                    <p>
                        Prior to my Help Desk position I worked in Digital Sales as an intern also at Fire Mountain
                        Gems. I worked on a big assortment of projects during my time in this position. Most of it was
                        physical file cleanup which turned to digital cleanup. A lot of my work was done in Word and
                        Excel; I worked on data entry, cost and data analysis, build promotional emails, and even worked
                        on SEO for the company's website and social media.

                    <p>
                        I plan to continue working in I.T. at my current position as it is teaching me so much about the
                        field. Looking further in the future, I plan to stay in a position anywhere that I can get my
                        hands on technology. As I further my career, I am now in the position to hunt for jobs within my
                        specialty. I don't have a dream job in mind yet, instead I hope to experience a variety of jobs
                        until I settle into a position that feels right.

                My name is Keon Bushman. I am a student at Grand Canyon University studying for my Bachelors of Science
                in Software Development. I live in Grants Pass Oregon where I am working in I.T. Operations as a Help
                Desk Technician at Fire Mountain Gems and Beads. I plan to continue pursuing a career centered around
                all things technology.
                <br><br>
                But enough about my career; I have some hobbies too. I really enjoy playing video games
                and competing in professional tournaments. I play chess, solve Rubik's puzzles, and like collecting
                retro games and Pop! Figures! And aside from all of my nerdy hobbies, I also have a passion for playing
                the drums.
                <br><br>
                Most importantly of all though, I am non-denomination Christian. I study apologetics and work on
                strengthening my faith and walk with God whenever and however I can. I also serve at my local church as
                a Middle School small group leader. That's just the gist of who I am, feel free to learn more about me
                throughout my site!
